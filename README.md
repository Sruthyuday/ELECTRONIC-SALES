# ELECTRONIC-SALES
I have created a Sales Dashboard to determine the following KPIs:
(1) Sales by Product
(2) Sales by City
(3) Sales by Sales Representatives
(4) Monthly Sales
(5) Category-wise Sales
The main Tools used are Pivot Tables and Slicer.
Overall, this project aims to empower businesses' insights to monitor, evaluate, and enhance their sales activities
by analyzing different divisions.
